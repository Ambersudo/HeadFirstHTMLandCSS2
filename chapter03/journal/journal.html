        Documenting my trip around the US on my very own Segway!

        Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed through some interesting places on the way:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Walla Walla, WA</li>
        <li>Magic City, ID</li>
        <li>Bountiful, UT</li>
        <li>Last Chance, CO</li>
        <li>Truth or Consequences, NM</li>
        <li>Why, AZ</li>
    </ul>

        I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:
        <q>Passing cars, When you can't see, May get you, A glimpse, Of eternity.</q>
        I definitely won't be passing any cars.

        My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:
    <ul>
        <li>cellphone</li>
        <li>iPod</li>
        <li>digital camera</li>
        <li>and a protein bar</li>
    </ul>
    Just the essentials. As Lao Tzu would have said,
    <q>
        A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway.
    </q>
